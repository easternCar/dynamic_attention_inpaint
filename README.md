# Dynamic Attention GAN for Image Inpainting
A PyTorch reimplementation for the paper [DAM-GAN : Image Inpainting using Dynamic Attention Map based on Fake Texture Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09442).

## Abstract 
Deep neural advancements have recently brought remarkable image synthesis performance to the field of image inpainting. The adaptation of generative adversarial networks(GAN) in particular has accelerated significant progress in high-quality image reconstruction. However, although many notable GAN-based networks have been proposed for image inpainting, still pixel artifacts or color inconsistency occur in synthesized images during the generation process, which are usually called fake textures. To reduce pixel inconsistency disorder resulted from fake textures, we introduce a GAN-based model using dynamic attention map (DAM-GAN). Our proposed DAM-GAN concentrates on detecting fake texture and products dynamic attention maps to diminish pixel inconsistency from the feature maps in the generator. Evaluation results on CelebA-HQ and Places2 datasets with other image inpainting approaches show the superiority of our network.
